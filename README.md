# Patent-Search-App

# Objective
In this codelab, I will work towards making the process of searching for patents faster, more intuitive, and incredibly precise by leveraging Spanner, and in-place Gemini 1.0 Pro, Embeddings and Vector Search.

# Steps To Build It.
1. Create a Spanner instance.
2. Load a Google Patents Public Datasets.
3. Create a remote model for text embeddings with Gemini 1.0 Pro model.
4. Create generative insights from loaded dataset.
5. Generate embeddings from the insights.
6. Issue similarity search queries against the dataset.
